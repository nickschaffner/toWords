# [toWords jQuery Plugin](http://www.ricardoaandres.com/code/towords)

toWords is a jQuery Plugin wich allows you to convert a numeric value to its equivalent literal string. From 0 to 999,999,999.

toWords will even take away every non-numeric character on the string, so if you type "iPhone 4S" the output will be "four".

**note: toWords will only work fine with integer values higher than 0.**

Download any of the two versions of toWords ( standard or minified ) and import it as shown below:
